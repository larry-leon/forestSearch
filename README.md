 Forest Search (FS) exploratoy subgroup identification 
 R directory contains source R code.  

Update 29-July-2024:  R code files have been updated (some updates to allow for more general treatment naming in dataset).   Analyses in FS-Applications directory contains scripts for simulated example (sim_ex-paper_v0.Rmd) and the GBSG data (gbsg_paper-reproduce-main_v0.Rmd). 

FS-Applications directory also contains 2 examples (as of 11-Dec-2023) run on Mac Studio (2022 M1 ultra with 20 cores): These are the simulated example described in the introduction, and the ACTG-175 example. Note that the simulated example also includes executing the simulation code.  Further files will be added for replicating simulations.  Recommend following code examples above for implementation.
